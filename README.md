 # Introduction

The Transit Secrets Engine provides the ability to generate a high-entropy key to support encryption locally. The premise is to support encryption services without routing the payload to Vault. The generation of the high-entropy key relies on an existing encryption endpoint that supports a named key.

 # Consumer Authentication and Authorization

Any consumer that interacts with Vault requires authentication. The basic premise is to use Vault to broker the consumer's identity against many authentication engines. Vault maintains a relationship using a role that matches a privileged role within the target identity and authentication engine. 

## Authentication
In the illustration below, the consumer uses an LDAP account to authenticate with Vaultâ€”the Vault LDAP Authentication engine aligns with the corporate LDAP Engine to verify and confirm the identity.

## Authorization
Once the consumer's identity is validated, Vault links internal access policies that describe the capabilities expressed for the consumer. Polices align with Vault users and Vault groups that reflect a hierarchical structure for the consumer's environment. 

From the diagram, **Application 01** can be an individual component managed by a unique identity. Or, **Application 01** is part of a group of resources all governed by a shared identity. In either case, the linked policies describe the authorization to the secrets engine for the consumer and its identity.

With a successful validation of the consumers's identity, Vault returns a payload that includes a bearer token. The consumer uses the token to access the desired Secrets Engine, and the policies linked to the token authorize the capabilities that the consumer can apply. 

# Encryption-as-a-Service

In general encryption-as-a-service practices, the expectation is that a service consumer routes the payload through the Transit Secrets Engine, receiving an encrypted blob in return. The service consumer is then responsible for storing the content in a desired endpoint with the encrypted material.

To illustrate with an example, assume a named key to support encryption services of documents. The key is configured the AES-GCM with a 256-bit AES and a 96-bit nonce mode operations and is used to support encryption, decryption, key derivation, and convergent encryption.
