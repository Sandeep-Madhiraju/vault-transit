 # Background

The Transit Secrets Engine provides the ability to generate a high-entropy key to support encryption locally. The premise is to support encryption services without routing the payload to Vault. The generation of the high-entropy key relies on an existing encryption endpoint that supports a named key.

## Consumer Authentication and Authorization

Any consumer that interacts with Vault requires authentication. The basic premise is to use Vault to broker the consumer's identity against many authentication engines. Vault maintains a relationship using a role that matches a privileged role within the target identity and authentication engine. 

### Authentication
In the illustration below, the consumer uses an LDAP account to authenticate with Vaultâ€”the Vault LDAP Authentication engine aligns with the corporate LDAP Engine to verify and confirm the identity.

For example, in a code example, we can use the Python [HVAC Client](https://hvac.readthedocs.io/) library to authenticate directly with Vault.

```python
    self.client.enable_auth_backend(
        backend_type='ldap',
        description=description,
        mount_point=ldap_auth_path,
    )
```

### Authorization
Once the consumer's identity is validated, Vault links internal access policies that describe the capabilities expressed for the consumer. Polices align with Vault users and Vault groups that reflect a hierarchical structure for the consumer's environment. 

From the diagram, **Application 01** can be an individual component managed by a unique identity. Or, **Application 01** is part of a group of resources all governed by a shared identity. In either case, the linked policies describe the authorization to the secrets engine for the consumer and its identity.

With a successful validation of the consumers's identity, Vault returns a payload that includes a bearer token. The consumer uses the token to access the desired Secrets Engine, and the policies linked to the token authorize the capabilities that the consumer can apply.

In a different scenario, interacting directly with the Vault CLI, a token can be prepared for direct access.

```bash
  vault token create -policy=app-01
```

The signifcance is the alignment with the desired policy which allows the consumer to access the resources described by the policy **app-01**.

```bash
  Key                  Value
  ---                  -----
  token                s.dHIi7Wf1dU2paz8GVnuc1UQO
  token_accessor       eJI7ogIBOkHaVkgVFcs2Ffeo
  token_duration       768h
  token_renewable      true
  token_policies       ["app-01" "default"]
  identity_policies    []
  policies             ["app-01" "default"]
```

The policy itself describes the encryption and decryption capabilities that apply to the Transit Secrets Engine end point.

```bash
path "transit/encrypt/app-01" {
   capabilities = [ "update" ]
}

path "transit/decrypt/app-01" {
   capabilities = [ "update" ]
}

```

## Encryption-as-a-Service

In general encryption-as-a-service practices, the expectation is that a service consumer routes the payload through the Transit Secrets Engine, receiving an encrypted blob in return. The service consumer is then responsible for storing the content in a desired endpoint with the encrypted material.

To illustrate with an example, assume a named key to support encryption services of documents. The endpoint **app-01** is configured with a AES-GCM with a 256-bit AES and a 96-bit nonce mode operations and is used to support encryption, decryption, key derivation, and convergent encryption.

In this context, the consumer routes a data blob through the encryption endpoint, and the secrets engine returns a response object that includes encrypted data. The consumer is responsible for safely storing the encrypted data on an appropriate storage medium.
